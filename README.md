# itvr

## System

ITVR system statuses and workflow can be [found documented in the flowchart](https://preview.uxpin.com/7f6104a26108508bb185e1b602677a5f91f49724#/pages/148655810/simulate/no-panels?mode=mf)

## Development

Unfortunately we do not have a licence to use Docker Desktop at BC Gov. If you are on a mac [here is a blogpost](https://naomiaro.hashnode.dev/replacing-docker-desktop-with-lima-on-mac-os) about how to setup Lima as an alternative solution for development purposes.

### Backend

The backend and all services are setup to run via docker. To start everything up you can run in the project folder:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start up a [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web app, and a [MinIO](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html) service with a private bucket `itvr`

Add this entry to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```sh
127.0.0.1 minio
```

#### Django

Django offers many helpful [mangement commands](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/django-admin/) out of the box. To be able to use these with docker you can access the python environment with bash:

```sh
docker-compose exec api bash
```

To create a Django admin user try running this command in the shell:

```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

The admin panel is available here: `http://localhost:8000/admin/`

You can view Django Restframework's browseable api here: `http://localhost:8000/api/`

Use a created superuser to login and view the api.

#### MinIO

You can view the contents of the bucket in MinIO by visiting `http://localhost:9001/login`. Use env variables `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` to login to the console. Default values are found in `minio.env`

We take advantage that MinIO is S3 compatible and use [django-storages](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html) S3 backend for media files.

### Auth

We are using a shared realm [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) client. Shared realm clients can be accessed and configured via [Common Hosted Single Sign-on (CSS)](https://bcgov.github.io/sso-requests)

Once added as a team member to existing projects (this project is called `itvr`), you can configure the redirect urls for each environment (dev, test, prod). Installation json is available as well as some helpful documentation about integrating the client.

### Email

We are using [CHES](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/common-components/common-hosted-email-service) to send email. Documentation is [available here](https://getok.nrs.gov.bc.ca/app/documentation)

To get access to the created client, go [request account](https://getok.nrs.gov.bc.ca/app/requestAccount) with application acronym `ITVR`. This will allow you to reset client secrets for environments (dev, test, prod) as needed.

### CRA

Submitting wage requests can be done manually by logging into
ftp://ftp-ot.cra-arc.gc.ca/pub/BC/iv/bcvr/ anonymously and dropping any encrypted files in the uaclient2cra folder. Within a short time the encrypted response will be available within the uacra2client folder. All security is trusted within the encryption algorithm. Anybody can download a file from here. Only the target user/computer can decrypt the file.

For the next valid sequence number:

If you ever are not sure, Susan can verify with ITB or send a request with the last sequence you are aware of and it will will fail but you will get an email notification indicating the error and what the next available sequence is.

Example of the contents of the error email for wrong sequence number:

THE FOLLOWING FILENAME IS EXCLUDED FROM PROCESSING PLEASE INVESTIGATE THE FILE LISTED BELOW:
INPUT FILENAME: DEMO.A00154
REASON : INVALID SEQUENCE NUMBER ON INPUT FILENAME

        THE NEXT VALID SEQUENCE NUMBER TO USE IS :   00155

## Frontend

We've decided to run the frontend outside of docker at this time mostly because of mounted Lima volumes causing issues with npm permissions. [Track the open issue](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/issues/693)

To run the frontend you will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. A good way to manage node these days is with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_1-install-dependencies). File `.tool-versions` contains current versions of tools used in this application. After setting up asdf run this at the project root:

```sh
asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
asdf install
```

The frontend is built using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). To run the frontend:

```sh
cd frontend
npm i
npm start
```

The app is available by default at `http://localhost:3000/`

### Storybook

To use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for developing a component:

```sh
cd frontend
npm run storybook
```

The storybook is available by default at `http://localhost:6006/`

## Deployment

We use [Openshift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) to deploy our applications. [Access the console here](https://console.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/k8s/cluster/projects)

There's training on Openshift offered by BCDevExchange. Check the [schedule here](https://bcdevexchange.org/learning)

### Git Process/ Rebasing

We use git for version control.
Each developer has their own fork of the repo and works off of branches from there
If another branch is merged in (eg from another developer) then the branch in progress will need
to be rebased before it gets merged in.

Steps:
git checkout release-branch
git fetch upstream
git pull --rebase upstream release-branch
git checkout featurebranch
git rebase release-branch

If there are any conflicts, you will have to step through each commit and fix them. After
conflicts are fixed and added (git add) then:

git rebase --continue

until all of the conflicts are fixed.

If you already have a branch at origin you'll have to force push, otherwise doing a
regular push will just give errors:
git push -f origin <feature-branch>

### Testing

backend tests will be recognized and run with other tests if they have follow this naming convention:
test\_[name].py
eg. test_calculate_rebate.py

to run tests use a terminal in the api container and type
python manage.py test

or to run specific test files, point to the folder or file
python manage.py test api.services.tests.test_calculate_rebate
